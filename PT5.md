**[PT1.1: 114] Use external penetration testers to find problems.**


Use external penetration testers to demonstrate that the organization’s code needs help. Breaking a high-profile application to provide unmistakable evidence that the organization isn’t somehow immune to the problem often gets the right attention. Over time, the focus of penetration testing moves from trying to determine if the code is broken in some areas to a sanity check done before shipping. External penetration testers that bring a new set of experiences and skills to the problem are the most useful.
