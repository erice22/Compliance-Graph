**[SM1.3: 75 Educate executives.**


Executives are regularly shown the ways malicious actors attack software and the negative business impacts they can have on the organization. Theyâ€™re also shown what other organizations are doing to mature software security, including how they deal with the risks of adopting emerging engineering methodologies with no oversight. By understanding both the problems and their proper resolutions, executives can support the SSI as a risk management necessity. In its most dangerous form, security education arrives courtesy of malicious hackers or public data exposure incidents. Preferably, the SSG will demonstrate a worst-case scenario in a controlled environment with the permission of all involved (e.g., by showing working exploits and their business impact). In some cases, presentation to the Board can help garner resources for a new or ongoing SSI efforts. Bringing in an outside guru is often helpful when seeking to bolster executive attention. Tying education to specific development areas, such as DevOps groups using cloud-native technologies, can likewise help convince leadership to accept SSG recommendations when they might otherwise be ignored in favor of faster release dates or other priorities.
