**[T3.3: 16] Host software security events.**


The organization highlights its security culture as a differentiator by hosting security events featuring external speakers and content. Good examples of such events are Intel iSecCon and AWS re:Inforce, which invite all employees, feature external presenters, and focus on helping engineering create, deploy, and operate better code. Employees benefit from hearing outside perspectives, especially those related to fast-moving technology areas, and the organization benefits from putting its security credentials on display (see [SM3.2 Run an external marketing program]). Events open only to small, select groups wonâ€™t result in the desired culture change across the organization.
