**[SM3.3: 18] Identify metrics and use them to drive resourcing.**


The SSG and its management choose the metrics that define and measure SSI progress in quantitative terms. These metrics are reviewed on a regular basis and drive the initiative’s budgeting and resource allocations, so simple counts and out-of-context measurements won’t suffice here. On the technical side, one such metric could be defect density, a reduction of which could be used to show a decreasing cost of remediation over time, assuming of course that testing depth has kept pace with software changes. Recall that, in agile methodologies, metrics are best collected early and often using event-driven processes with telemetry rather than point-in-time data collection. The key is to tie security results to business objectives in a clear and obvious fashion in order to justify funding. Because the concept of security is already tenuous to many business people, making an explicit tie-in can be helpful.
