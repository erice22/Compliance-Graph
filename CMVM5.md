**[CMVM1.1: 108] Create or interface with incident response.**


The SSG is prepared to respond to an event or alert, and is regularly included in the incident response process, either by creating its own incident response capability or by regularly interfacing with the organizationâ€™s existing team. A regular meeting between the SSG and the incident response team can keep information flowing in both directions. Having pre-built communication channels with critical vendors (e.g., infrastructure, SaaS, PaaS) is also very important.
