**[ST3.6: 0] Implement event-driven security testing in automation.**


The SSG guides implementation of automation for continuous, event-driven application security testing. Event-driven testing implemented in ALM automation typically moves the testing closer to the conditions driving the testing requirement (whether shift left toward design or shift right toward operations), repeats the testing as often as the event is triggered as software moves through ALM, and helps ensure the right testing is executed for a given set of conditions. This might be instead of or in addition to software arriving at a gate or checkpoint and triggering a point-in-time security test. Success with this approach depends on broad use of sensors (e.g., agents, bots) that monitor engineering processes, execute contextual rules, and provide telemetry to automation that initiates the specified testing whenever event conditions are met. More mature configurations proceed to including risk-driven conditions.
