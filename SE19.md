**[SE3.3: 7] Use application behavior monitoring and diagnostics.**


The organization monitors production software to look for misbehavior or signs of attack. This activity goes beyond host and network monitoring to look for software-specific problems, such as indications of malicious behavior, fraud, and related issues. Intrusion detection and anomaly detection systems at the application level might focus on an application’s interaction with the operating system (through system calls) or with the kinds of data that an application consumes, originates, and manipulates. In any case, the signs that an application isn’t behaving as expected will be specific to the software and its environment, so one-size-fits-all solutions probably won’t generate satisfactory results. In some types of environments (e.g., PaaS), some of this data and the associated predictive analytics might come from a vendor.
