**[ST2.1: 42] Integrate black-box security tools into the QA process.**


The organization uses one or more black-box security testing tools as part of the QA process. Such tools are valuable because they encapsulate an attackerâ€™s perspective, albeit generically. Traditional dynamic analysis scanners are relevant for web applications, while similar tools exist for cloud environments, containers, mobile applications, embedded systems, and so on. In some situations, other groups might collaborate with the SSG to apply the tools. For example, a testing team could run the tool but come to the SSG for help interpreting the results. When testing is integrated into agile development approaches, black-box tools might be hooked into internal toolchains, might be provided by cloud-based toolchains, or be used directly by engineering. Regardless of who runs the black-box tool, the testing should be properly integrated into a QA cycle of the SSDL and will often include both authenticated and unauthenticated reviews.
