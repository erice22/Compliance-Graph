**[T3.4: 19] Require an annual refresher.**


Everyone involved in the SSDL is required to take an annual software security refresher course. This course keeps the staff up to date on the organization’s security approach and ensures the organization doesn’t lose focus due to turnover, evolving methodologies, or changing deployment models. The SSG might give an update on the security landscape and explain changes to policies and standards. A refresher could also be rolled out as part of a firm-wide security day or in concert with an internal security conference, but it’s useful only if it’s fresh. Sufficient coverage of topics and changes from the previous year will likely comprise a significant amount of content.
