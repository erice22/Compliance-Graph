**[AA3.1: 11] Have engineering teams lead AA process.**


Engineering teams lead the AA process most of the time. This effort requires a well-understood and well-documented process (see [AA2.1 Define and use AA process]), although the SSG still might contribute to AA in an advisory capacity or under special circumstances. Even with a good process, consistency is difficult to attain because breaking architecture requires experience, so provide architects with SSG or outside expertise on novel issues. In any given organization, the identified engineering team might normally have responsibilities such as development, DevOps, cloud security, operations security, security architecture, or a variety of similar roles.
