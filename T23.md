**[T3.2: 22] Provide training for vendors and outsourced workers.**


Vendors and outsourced workers receive the same level of software security training given to employees. Spending time and effort helping suppliers get security right at the outset is much easier than trying to determine what went wrong later on, especially if the development team has moved on to other projects. Training individual contractors is much more natural than training entire outsource firms and is a reasonable place to start. It’s important that everyone who works on the firm’s software has an appropriate level of training, regardless of their employment status. Of course, some vendors and outsourced workers might have received adequate training from their own firms, but that should always be verified.
