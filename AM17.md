**[AM2.5: 16] Build and maintain a top N possible attacks list.**


The SSG periodically digests the ever-growing list of attack types and focuses the organization on prevention efforts for a prioritized short list—the topN—and uses it to drive change. This initial list almost always combines input from multiple sources, both inside and outside the organization. Some organizations prioritize their list according to perception of potential business loss while others might prioritize according to successful attacks against their software. The top N list doesn’t need to be updated with great frequency, and attacks can be coarsely sorted. For example, the SSG might brainstorm twice a year to create lists of attacks the organization should be prepared to counter “now,” “soon,” and “someday.”
