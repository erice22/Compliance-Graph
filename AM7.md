**[AM1.3: 38] Identify potential attackers.**


The SSG identifies potential attackers in order to understand their motivations and abilities. The outcome of this exercise could be a set of attacker profiles that includes outlines for categories of attackers and more detailed descriptions for noteworthy individuals. In some cases, a third-party vendor might be contracted to provide this information. Specific and contextual attacker information is almost always more useful than generic information copied from someone else’s list. Moreover, a list that simply divides the world into insiders and outsiders won’t drive useful results. Identification of attackers should account for the organization’s evolving software supply chain and attack surface.
