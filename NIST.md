The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework is a voluntary framework-- based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices- for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It was created in 2013 when the United States President issued Exectutive Order (EO) 13636 "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity." The Framework is not meant to be a blanket checklist or one-size fits all approach to cybersecurity, but rather should be customized by different sectors to suit their specific risks, situations, and needs. Although the Framework was designed for U.S. critical infrastructure companies, NIST encourages organizations across the private and public sectors to consider the Framework a helpful tool in managing cyber security risks.
