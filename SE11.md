**[SE2.2: 39] Define secure deployment parameters and configurations.**


The SSDL requires creating an installation guide or a clearly described configuration for deployable software artifacts and the infrastructure-as-code necessary to deploy them, helping teams install and configure software securely. When special steps are required to ensure a deployment is secure, these steps can be outlined in a configuration guide or explicitly described in deployment automation, including information on COTS, vendor, and cloud services components. In some cases, installation guides are not used internally but are distributed to customers who buy the software. All deployment automation should be understandable by humans, not just by machines. Increasingly, secure deployment parameters and configuration are codified into infrastructure scripting (e.g., Terraform, Helm, Ansible, and Chef).
