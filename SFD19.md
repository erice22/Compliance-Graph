**[SFD3.2: 14] Require use of approved security features and frameworks.**


Implementers take their security features and frameworks from an approved list or repository. There are two benefits to this activity: developers don’t spend time reinventing existing capabilities, and review teams don’t have to contend with finding the same old defects in new projects or when new platforms are adopted. Essentially, the more a project uses proven components, the easier testing, [code review](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-code-review.html), and [architecture analysis](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/software-security-services/software-architecture-design.html) become (see [AA1.1 Perform security feature review]). Reuse is a major advantage of consistent software architecture and is particularly helpful for [agile development](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-agile-sdlc.html) and velocity maintenance in CI/CD pipelines. Packaging and applying required components facilitates delivering services as software features (e.g., identity-aware proxies). Containerization makes it especially easy to package and reuse approved features and frameworks (see [SE2.5 Use application containers]).
