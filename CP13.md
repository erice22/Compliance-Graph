**[CP2.2: 47] Require security sign-off for compliance-related risk.**


The organization has a formal compliance risk acceptance and accountability process that addresses all software development projects. In that process, the SSG acts as an advisor while the risk owner signs off on the software’s state prior to release based on adherence to documented criteria. For example, the sign-off policy might require the head of the business unit to sign off on compliance issues that haven’t been mitigated or on compliance-related SSDL steps that have been skipped. Sign-off is explicit and captured for future reference, with any exceptions tracked, even under the fastest of application lifecycle methodologies. Note that an application without security defects might still be noncompliant ,so a clean penetration test is not a substitute for a compliance sign-off. Even in DevOps organizations where engineers have the technical ability to release software, there is still a need for a deliberate risk acceptance step even if the criteria are embedded in automation. In cases where the risk owner signs off on a particular set of compliance acceptance criteria that are then implemented in automation to provide governance-as-code, there must be an ongoing verification that the criteria remain accurate and the automation is actually working.
