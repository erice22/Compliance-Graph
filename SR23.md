**[SR3.2: 9] Communicate standards to vendors.**


The SSG works with vendors to educate them and promote the organization’s security standards. A healthy relationship with a vendor isn’t guaranteed through contract language alone, so the SSG should engage with vendors, discuss vendor security practices, and explain in concrete terms (rather than legalese) what the organization expects of its vendors. Any time a vendor adopts the organization’s security standards, it’s a clear sign of progress. Note that standards implemented as security features or infrastructure configuration could be a requirement to services integration with a vendor (see [SFD1.1 Integrate and deliver security features]). When the firm’s SSDL is publicly available, communication regarding software security expectations is easier. Likewise, sharing internal practices and measures can make expectations clear.
