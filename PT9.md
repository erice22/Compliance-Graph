[[BSIMM]] #deployment #penetration_testing
**[PT1.3: 89] Use penetration testing tools internally.**


The organization creates an internal penetration testing capability that uses tools. This capability (e.g., group, team) can be part of the SSG or part of a specialized team elsewhere in the organization, with the tools complementing manual efforts to improve the efficiency and repeatability of the testing process. Tools used usually include off-the-shelf products built specifically for application penetration testing, network penetration tools that specifically understand the application layer, container and cloud configuration testing tools, and custom scripts. Free-time or crisis-driven efforts arenâ€™t the same as an internal capability.
