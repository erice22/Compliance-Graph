**[ST1.1: 104] Ensure QA performs edge/boundary value condition testing.**


QA efforts go beyond functional testing to perform basic adversarial tests and probe simple edge cases and boundary conditions, with no particular attacker skills required. When QA understands the value of pushing past standard functional testing that uses expected input, it begins to move slowly toward thinking like an adversary. A discussion of boundary value testing can lead naturally to the notion of an attacker probing the edges on purpose (for example, determining what happens when someone enters the wrong password over and over).
