**[SR2.5: 44] Create SLA boilerplate.**


The SSG works with the legal department to create standard SLA boilerplate for use in contracts with vendors and outsource providers (including cloud providers) to require software security efforts. The legal department understands that the boilerplate also helps prevent compliance and privacy problems. Under the agreement, vendors and outsource providers must meet company-mandated software security standards (see [CP2.4 Include software security SLAs in all vendor contracts]). Boilerplate language might call for objective third-party insight into software security efforts, such as BSIMMsc measurements or BSIMM scores.
