**[SE2.5: 31] Use application containers.**


The organization uses application containers to support its software security goals, which likely include ease of deployment, a tighter coupling of applications with their dependencies, immutability, integrity (see [SE2.4 Protect code integrity]), and some isolation benefits without the overhead of deploying a full operating system on a virtual machine. Containers provide a convenient place for security controls to be applied and updated consistently. While containers can be useful in development and test environments, production use provides the needed security benefits.
