**[AA3.3: 6] Make the SSG available as an AA resource or mentor.**


To build an AA capability outside of the SSG, the SSG advertises itself as a resource or mentor for teams that ask for help in using the AA process (see [AA2.1 Define and use AA process]) to conduct their own design reviews. The SSG might answer AA questions during office hours and, in some cases, might assign someone to sit with the architect for the duration of the analysis. In the case of high-risk software, the SSG should play a more active mentorship role in applying the AA process.
