**[SR1.1: 93] Create security standards.**


The SSG meets the organization’s demand for security guidance by creating standards that explain the required way to adhere to policy and carry out specific security-centric operations. A standard might describe how to perform identity-based application authentication or how to determine the authenticity of a software update, perhaps with the SSG ensuring the availability of a reference implementation. Standards often apply to software beyond the scope of an application’s code, including container construction, orchestration (e.g., infrastructure-as-code), and service mesh configuration. Standards can be deployed in a variety of ways to keep them actionable and relevant. They can be automated into development environments (e.g., worked into an IDE or toolchain), or they can be explicitly linked to code examples and deployment artifacts (e.g., containers). In any case, to be considered standards, they must be adopted and enforced.
