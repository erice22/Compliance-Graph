**[AM2.2: 10] Create technology-specific attack patterns.**


The SSG facilitates technology-specific attack pattern creation by collecting and providing knowledge about attacks relevant to the organization’s technologies. For example, if the organization’s cloud software relies on a cloud vendor’s security apparatus (e.g., key and secrets management), the SSG can help catalog the quirks of the crypto package and how it might be exploited. Attack patterns directly related to the security frontier (e.g., serverless) can be useful here as well. It’s often easiest to start with existing generalized attack patterns to create the needed technology-specific attack patterns, but simply adding, for example, “for microservices” at the end won’t suffice.
