**[ST3.5: 2] Begin to build and apply adversarial security tests (abuse cases).**


QA begins to incorporate test cases based on abuse cases (see [AM2.1 Build attack patterns and abuse cases tied to potential attackers]) as testers move beyond verifying functionality and take on the attacker’s perspective. One way to do this is to systematically attempt to replicate incidents from the organization’s history. Abuse and misuse cases based on the attacker’s perspective can also be derived from security policies, attack intelligence, standards, and the organization’s top N attacks list (see [AM2.5 Build and maintain a top N possible attacks list]). This effort turns the corner from testing features to attempting to break the software under test.
