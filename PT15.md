**[PT2.3: 29] Schedule periodic penetration tests for application coverage.**


The SSG collaborates in periodically testing all applications in its purview according to an established schedule, which could be tied to a calendar or a release cycle. High-profile applications should get a penetration test at least once a year, even if new releases haven’t yet moved into production. This testing serves as a sanity check and helps ensure that yesterday’s software isn’t vulnerable to today’s attacks. The testing can also help maintain the security of software configurations and environments, especially containers and components in the cloud. One important aspect of periodic testing is to make sure that the problems identified are actually fixed and don’t creep back into the build. New automation created for [CI/CD](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/solutions/by-security-need/cicd.html) deserves penetration testing as well.
