**[AM2.1: 12] Build attack patterns and abuse cases tied to potential attackers.**


The SSG prepares the organization for SSDL activities by working with stakeholders to build attack patterns and abuse cases tied to potential attackers (see [AM1.3 Identify potential attackers]). However, these resources donâ€™t have to be built from scratch for every application in order to be useful; rather, standard sets might exist for applications with similar profiles, and the SSG can add to the pile based on its own attack stories. For example, a story about an attack against a poorly designed cloud-native application could lead to a containerization attack pattern that drives a new type of testing. If a firm tracks the fraud and monetary costs associated with particular attacks, this information can in turn be used to prioritize the process of building attack patterns and abuse cases. Evolving software architectures (e.g., zero trust, serverless) might require organizations to evolve their attack pattern and abuse case creation approach and content.
