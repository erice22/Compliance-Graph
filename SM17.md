**[SM2.3: 55] Create or grow a satellite.**


Create a collection of people scattered across the organization who show an above-average level of security interest or skillâ€”a satellite. Forming this group of advocates, sometimes referred to as champions, is a step toward scaling security by creating a social network that speeds the adoption of security into software engineering. One way to build the initial group is to track the people who stand out during introductory training courses; see [T3.6 Identify new satellite members through observation]. Another way is to ask for volunteers. In a more top-down approach, initial satellite membership is assigned to ensure good coverage of development groups, but ongoing membership is based on actual performance. A strong satellite is a good sign of a mature SSI. The satellite can act as a sounding Board for new SSG projects and, in new or fast-moving technology areas, can help combine software security skills with domain knowledge that might be under-represented in the SSG or engineering teams. Agile coaches, scrum masters, and DevOps engineers can make particularly useful satellite members, especially for detecting and removing process friction. In some agile environments, satellite-led efforts are being replaced by automation.
