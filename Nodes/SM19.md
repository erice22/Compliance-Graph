**[SM2.6: 65] Require security sign-off.**


The organization has an initiative-wide process for accepting security risk and documenting accountability, with a risk owner signing off on the state of all software prior to release. The sign-off policy might require the head of a business unit to sign-off on critical vulnerabilities that have not been mitigated or on SSDL steps that have been skipped, for example. The sign-off policy must apply both to outsourced projects and to projects that will be deployed in external environments, such as the cloud. Informal or uninformed risk acceptance alone isn’t a security sign-off because the act of accepting risk is more effective when it’s formalized (e.g., with a signature, a form submission, or something similar) and captured for future reference. Similarly, simply stating that certain projects don’t need sign-off at all won’t achieve the desired risk management results. In some cases, however, the risk owner can provide the sign-off on a particular set of software project acceptance criteria, which are then implemented in automation to provide governance-as-code, but there must be an ongoing verification that the criteria remain accurate and the automation is actually working.
