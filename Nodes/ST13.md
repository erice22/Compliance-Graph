**[ST2.4: 20] Share security results with QA.**


The SSG or others with security testing data routinely share results from security reviews with those responsible for QA. Using security testing results as the basis for a conversation about common attack patterns or the underlying causes of security defects allows QA to generalize that information into new test approaches. Organizations that have chosen to leverage software pipeline platforms such as GitHub, or CI/CD platforms such as the Atlassian stack, can benefit from QA receiving various testing results automatically, which should then facilitate timely stakeholder conversations. In some cases, these platforms can be used to integrate QA into automated remediation workflow and reporting by generating change request tickets for developers, lightening the QA workload. Over time, QA learns the security mindset, and the organization benefits from an improved ability to create security tests tailored to the organizationâ€™s code.
