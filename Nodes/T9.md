**[T1.7: 53] Deliver on-demand individual training.**


The organization lowers the burden on students and reduces the cost of delivering training by offering on-demand training for individuals across roles. The most obvious choice, e-learning, can be kept up to date through a subscription model, but an online curriculum must be engaging and relevant to the students in various roles to achieve its intended purpose. Training that isn’t used won’t create any change. Hot topics like containerization and security orchestration and new delivery styles such as gamification will attract more interest than boring policy discussions. For developers, it’s possible to provide training directly through the IDE right when it’s needed, but in some cases, building a new skill (such as [cloud security](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/security-in-the-cloud.html) or [threat modeling](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/software-security-services/software-architecture-design/threat-modeling.html)) might be better suited for instructor-led training, which can also be provided on demand.
