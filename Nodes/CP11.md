**[CP2.1: 55] Build PII inventory.**


The organization identifies and tracks the kinds of PII processed or stored by each of its systems, along with their associated data repositories. A PII inventory might be approached in two ways: starting with each individual application by noting its PII use or starting with particular types of PII and noting the applications that touch them. System architectures have evolved such that PII will flow into cloud-based service and endpoint device ecosystems, and come to rest there (e.g., content delivery networks, social networks, mobile devices, IoT devices), making it tricky to keep an accurate PII inventory. In general, simply noting which applications process PII isnâ€™t enough; the type of PII and where it is stored are necessary so the inventory can be easily referenced in critical situations. This usually includes making a list of databases that would require customer notification if breached or a list to use in crisis simulations (see [CMVM3.3 Simulate software crises]).
