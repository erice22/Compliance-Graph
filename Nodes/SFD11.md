**[SFD2.1: 32] Leverage secure-by-design components and services.**


The SSG takes a proactive role in software design by building or providing pointers to secure-by-design software components and services. In addition to teaching by example, these resilient building blocks aid important efforts such as architecture analysis and code review by making it easier to spot errors and avoid mistakes. These components and services, whether created internally or available from service providers, often have features (e.g., application identity, RBAC) that enable uniform security orchestration across, for example, multi-environment deployments. Similarly, the SSG might further leverage this information by tailoring code review rules specifically for the components it offers (see [CR2.6 Use automated tools with tailored rules]). When integrating software components, including open source and cloud services, the SSG must carefully vet the software for security before publication.Â
