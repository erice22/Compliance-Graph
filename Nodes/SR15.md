**[SR2.4: 60] Identify open source.**


Open source components included in the software portfolio and integrated at runtime are identified and reviewed to understand their dependencies. Organizations use a variety of tools and metadata provided by delivery pipelines to discover old versions of components with known vulnerabilities or that their software relies on multiple versions of the same component. Automated tools for finding open source, whether whole components or large chunks of borrowed code, are one way to approach this activity. Some software development pipeline platforms, container registries, and middleware platforms such as RedHatâ€™s OpenShift, have begun to provide this visibility as metadata resulting from behind-the-scenes artifact scanning. An informal annual review or a process that relies solely on developers asking for permission does not generate satisfactory results. Some organizations combine composition analysis results from multiple phases of the software lifecycle in order to get a more complete and accurate view of the open source being included.
