Start a high-level written description of each compliance framework. If we consider that this can be a readout for a developer to read, a brief what/why and how it's implemented on one or several markdown files in a repository will be a great way to store that info

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is aimed at providing a single set of data privacy laws across the European Union.  As of May 25, 2018, all orginizations were required to be compliant. A key tenent of GDPR is that everything you do in your organization must "by design and default" consider data protection. GDPR provides protocols for how businesses and other organizations handle information relating to the individuals who interact with them. The GDPR applies outside of Europe when a company intends to provide a good or service to European citizens on more than a occasional basis, or if an organization is tracking the cookies or IP addresses of those who visit their website from EU countries. Being compliant with GDPR requires an understanding of whether the information they process could be classified as personal data, which is onsidered to be any personal information which relates to an individual who can be indentified or is identifiable (customer number, an address, or credit card number) also perceive an IP address or cookie to be additional wasy in which an individual may be directly identified.

There are seven data protection and accountability principles outlined in the GDPR. 
* Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
* purpose limitation:  You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.
* Data minimization: You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.
* Accuracy: You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.
* Storage limitation: You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.
* integrity and confidentiality:Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).
* accountability:1.  The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.



GDPR requires that organizations implement **a consent system that must be completely unambiguous and requires a clear opt-in**. The use of pre-selected opt-in boxes has been specifically banned, and there need to be consent options for the processing of personal data in different ways.
Obtaining consent is the first step in ensuring GDPR compliance. Once this is achieved, then there is then the requirement to keep accurate records that provide evidence of that consent, including, who gave it, when it was given, by what means, and what the individual was told at the point of giving it.

When an organization has over 250 employees, then the GDPR requires them to establish an up to date and detailed list of the processing which is undertaken. This should include details of why the processing is taking place, the type of data being processed, and details of who has access to it.

**A data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is a method of measuring the risk associated with personal data processing.**
Where it has been assessed that there is the potential for high risk through personal data processing, then the DPIA is a mandatory requirement to achieve the GDPR.

The key principle of data protection is for it to be **‘by design and by default’**.

Should there be a data breach resulting in personal data exposure, then a procedure should be in place, which can be implemented without delay. Data protection law states that there is a time limit of 72 hours for notifying the supervisory authority with the count down commencing at the point of becoming aware of the data breach.

Additional requirements to ensure GDPR compliance include keeping a time-based account of the actions taken to limit the potential risk to the European Union’s citizens and residents.

With the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being to safeguard personal data, there needs to be the appointment of someone within an organization who takes overall responsibility for its implementation. It is generally recommended that a Data Protection Officer is appointed.

**If the organization is outside of the EU, then there is a requirement to appoint a representative within the country that the personal data is being collected**. The role of this representative, usually from a law firm, consultancy, or private company, is to represent the organization regarding their obligations under the EU GDPR.
