**[SFD1.2: 76] Engage the SSG with architecture teams.**


Security is a regular topic in the organization’s [software architecture](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/software-security-services/software-architecture-design.html) discussions, with the architecture team taking responsibility for security in the same way that it takes responsibility for performance, availability, scalability, and resiliency. One way to keep security from falling out of these discussions is to have an SSG member participate in architecture discussions. Increasingly, architecture discussions include developers and site reliability engineers governing all types of software components, such as open source, APIs, containers, and cloud services. In other cases, enterprise architecture teams can help the SSG create secure designs that integrate properly into corporate design standards. Proactive engagement by the SSG is key to success here. Moving a well-known system to the cloud means reengaging the SSG, for example. It’s never safe for one team to assume another team has addressed security requirements.
