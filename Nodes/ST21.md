**[ST3.3: 5] Drive tests with risk analysis results.**


Testers use architecture analysis results (see [AA 2.1 Define and use AA process]) to direct their work. If the AA determines that “the security of the system hinges on the transactions being atomic and not being interrupted partway through,” for example, then torn transactions will become a primary target in adversarial testing. Adversarial tests like these can be developed according to risk profile, with high-risk flaws at the top of the list. Security testing results shared with QA (see [ST 2.4 Share security results with QA]) can help focus test creation on areas of potential vulnerability that can, in turn, help prove the existence of identified high-risk flaws.
