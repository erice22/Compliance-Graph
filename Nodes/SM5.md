**[SM1.2: 70] Create evangelism role and perform internal marketing.**


The SSG builds support for [software security](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) throughout the organization through ongoing evangelism. This internal marketing function, often performed by a variety of stakeholder roles, keeps executives and others up to date on the magnitude of the software security problem and the elements of its solution. A scrum master familiar with security, for example, could help teams adopt better [software security practices](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/top-10-software-security-best-practices/) as they transform to an agile methodology. Evangelists can increase understanding and build credibility by giving talks to internal groups (including executives), publishing roadmaps, authoring white papers for internal consumption, or creating a collection of papers, books, and other resources on an internal website and promoting its use.
