 **[SE3.5: 22] Use orchestration for containers and virtualized environments.**


The organization uses automation to scale service, container, and virtualized environments in a disciplined way. Orchestration processes take advantage of built-in and add-on security features, such as hardening against drift, secrets management, and rollbacks (see [SDF2.1 Leverage secure-by-design components and services]), to ensure each deployed workload meets predetermined security requirements. Setting security behaviors in aggregate allows for rapid change when the need arises. Orchestration platforms are themselves software that become part of your production environment, which in turn requires hardening and security patching and configuration; in other words, if you use Kubernetes, make sure you patch Kubernetes.
