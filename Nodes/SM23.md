**[SM3.1: 27] Use a software asset tracking application with portfolio view.**


The SSG uses centralized tracking automation to chart the progress of every piece of software and deployable artifact (e.g., container registries) in its purview, regardless of development methodology. The automation records the security activities scheduled, in progress, and completed, incorporating results from SSDL activities even when they happen in a tight loop or during deployment. The combined inventory and security posture view enables timely decision-making. The SSG uses the automation to generate portfolio reports for multiple metrics and, in many cases, publishes these data at least among executives. Depending on the culture, this can cause interesting effects via internal competition. As an initiative matures and activities become more distributed, the SSG uses the centralized reporting system to keep track of all the moving parts.
