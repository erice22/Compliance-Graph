**[CMVM3.3: 13] Simulate software crises.**


The SSG simulates high-impact software security crises to ensure software incident detection and response capabilities minimize damage. Simulations could test for the ability to identify and mitigate specific threats or, in other cases, begin with the assumption that a critical system or service is already compromised and evaluate the organizationâ€™s ability to respond. Planned chaos engineering can be effective at triggering unexpected conditions during simulations. The exercises must include attacks or other software security crises at the appropriate software layer to generate useful results (e.g., at the application layer for web applications and at lower layers for IoT devices). When simulations model successful attacks, an important question to consider is the time required to clean up. Regardless, simulations must focus on security-relevant software failure and not on natural disasters or other types of emergency response drills. Organizations that are highly dependent on vendor infrastructure (e.g., cloud service providers, SaaS, PaaS) and security features will naturally include those things in crisis simulations.
