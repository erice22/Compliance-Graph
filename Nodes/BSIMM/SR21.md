**[SR3.1: 30] Control open source risk.**


The organization has control over its exposure to the risks that come along with using open source components and all the involved dependencies, including dependencies integrated at runtime. The use of open source could be restricted to predefined projects or to a short list of open source versions that have been through an approved security screening process, have had unacceptable vulnerabilities remediated, and are made available only through specific internal repositories and containers. For some use cases, policy might preclude any use of open source. The legal department often spearheads additional open source controls due to the “viral” license problem associated with GPL code. SSGs that partner with and educate the legal department on [open source security risks](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/2020-ossra-findings-infographic/) can help move an organization to improve its open source risk management practices, which must be applied across the software portfolio to be effective.
