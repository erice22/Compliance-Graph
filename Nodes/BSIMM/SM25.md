**[SM3.2: 4] Run an external marketing program.**


To build external awareness, the SSG helps market the SSI beyond internal teams. In this way, software security can grow risk reduction exercises into a competitive advantage or market differentiator. The SSG might publish papers or books about its software security capabilities or have a public blog. It might provide details at external conferences or trade shows. In some cases, a complete [SSDL methodology](https://www.bsimm.com/framework/software-security-development-lifecycle.html) can be published and promoted outside the firm, and governance-as-code concepts can make interesting case studies. Regardless of venue, the process of sharing details externally and inviting critique is used to bring new perspectives into the firm.
