**[SFD3.3: 4] Find and publish secure design patterns from the organization.**


The SSG fosters centralized design reuse by collecting secure design patterns (sometimes referred to as security blueprints) from across the organization and publishing them for everyone to use. A section of the SSG website could promote positive elements identified during threat modeling or architecture analysis so that good ideas are spread. This process is formalized: an ad hoc, accidental noticing isn’t sufficient. In some cases, a central architecture or technology team can facilitate and enhance this activity. Common design patterns accelerate development, so it’s important to use secure design patterns not just for applications but for all software assets (microservices, APIs, containers, infrastructure, and automation).
