**[T2.8: 28] Create and use material specific to company history.**


To make a strong and lasting change in behavior, training includes material specific to the company’s history. When participants can see themselves in a problem, they’re more likely to understand how the material is relevant to their work as well as when and how to apply what they’ve learned. One way to do this is to use noteworthy attacks on the company’s software as examples in the training curriculum. Both successful and unsuccessful attacks can make good teachable moments. Stories from company history can help steer training in the right direction, but only if those stories are still relevant and not overly censored. This training shouldn’t cover platforms not used by developers (developers orchestrating containers probably won’t care about old virtualization problems) or examples of problems relevant only to languages no longer in common use (e.g., Go developers probably don’t need to understand how buffer overflows happen in C).
