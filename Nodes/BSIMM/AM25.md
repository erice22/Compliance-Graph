**[AM3.1: 3] Have a research group that develops new attack methods.**


A research group works to identify and defang new classes of attacks before attackers even know that they exist. Because the security implications of new technologies might not have been fully explored in the wild, doing it in-house is sometimes the best way forward. This isn’t a penetration testing team finding new instances of known types of weaknesses—it’s a research group that innovates new types of attacks. Some firms provide researchers time to follow through on their discoveries using bug bounty programs or other means of coordinated disclosure. Others allow researchers to publish their findings at conferences like DEF CON to benefit everyone.
