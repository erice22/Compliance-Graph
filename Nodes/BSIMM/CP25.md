**[CP3.2: 16] Impose policy on vendors.**


Vendors are required to adhere to the same policies used internally and must submit evidence that their software security practices pass muster. For a given organization, vendors might comprise cloud providers, middleware providers, virtualization providers, container and orchestration providers, bespoke software creators, contractors, and many more, and each might be held to different policy requirements. Evidence of their compliance could include results from SSDL activities or from tests built directly into automation or infrastructure. Vendors might attest to the fact that they perform certain SSDL processes. Policy enforcement might be through a point-in-time review (like that which assures acceptance criteria), enforced by automated checks (such as are applied to pull requests, committed artifacts like containers, or similar), or a matter of convention and protocol (e.g., services cannot connect unless particular security settings are correct, identifying certificates present, and so forth).Â
