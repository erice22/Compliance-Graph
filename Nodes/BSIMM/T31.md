**[T3.6: 1] Identify new satellite members through observation.**


Recruit future satellite members (e.g., champions) by noting people who stand out during training courses, office hours, capture-the-flag exercises, hack-a-thons, and other opportunities to show skill and enthusiasm, and them encouraging them to join the satellite. Pay particular attention to practitioners contributing code, security configuration for orchestration, or defect discovery rules. The satellite often begins as an assigned collection of people scattered across the organization who show an above-average level of security interest or advanced knowledge of new technology stacks and development methodologies (see [SM2.3 Create or grow a satellite]). Identifying future members proactively is a step toward creating a social network that speeds the adoption of security into software development and operations. A group of enthusiastic and skilled volunteers will be easier to lead than a group that is drafted.Â
