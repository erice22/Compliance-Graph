**[SM3.4: 1] Integrate software-defined lifecycle governance.**


Organizations begin replacing traditional document, presentation, and spreadsheet-based lifecycle management with software-based delivery platforms. Humans, sometimes aided by tools, are no longer the primary drivers of progression from each lifecycle phase to the next. Instead, organizations rely on automation to drive the management and delivery process with ALM/ADLM software, such as Spinnaker or pipeline platform software like GitHub, and humans participate asynchronously (and often optionally), like services. Automation often extends beyond the scope of CI/CD to include functional and nonfunctional aspects of delivery, including health checks, cut-over on failure, rollback to known-good software, defect discovery and management, compliance verification, and a way to ensure adherence to policies and standards. Some organizations are also evolving their lifecycle management approach by integrating their compliance and defect discovery data to begin moving from a series of point-in-time go/no-go decisions (e.g., release conditions) to a future state of continuous accumulation of assurance data (e.g., output from sensors embedded in development and production). Lifecycle governance extends beyond defect discovery, and often includes incorporation of intelligence feeds and third-party security research, vulnerability disclosure and patching processes, as well as other activities.
