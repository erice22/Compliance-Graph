**[CP2.5: 70] Ensure executive awareness of compliance and privacy obligations.**


To gain executive buy-in around compliance and privacy activities, the SSG provides executives with plain-language explanations of the organizationâ€™s compliance and privacy obligations, along with the potential consequences of failing to meet those obligations. For some organizations, explaining the direct cost and likely fallout from a compliance failure or data breach can be an effective way to broach the subject. For others, having an outside expert address the Board works because some executives value an outside perspective more than an internal one. A sure sign of proper executive buy-in is an acknowledgment of the need and adequate allocation of resources to meet those obligations. While useful for bootstrapping efforts, be aware that the sense of urgency typically following a breach will not last.
