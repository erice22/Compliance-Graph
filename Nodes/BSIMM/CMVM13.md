**[CMVM2.2: 97] Track software bugs found in operations through the fix process.**


Defects found in operations are entered into established defect management systems and tracked through the fix process. This capability could come in the form of a two-way bridge between bug finders and bug fixers, but make sure the loop is closed completely. Bugs can crop up in all types of deployable artifacts, deployment automation, and infrastructure configuration. Setting a security flag in the bug-tracking system can help facilitate tracking.
