**[CP2.3: 61] Implement and track controls for compliance.**


The organization can demonstrate compliance with applicable requirements because its SSDL is aligned with the control statements developed by the SSG in collaboration with compliance stakeholders (see [CP1.1 Unify regulatory pressures]). The SSG collaborates with stakeholders to track controls, navigate problem areas, and ensure auditors and regulators are satisfied. The SSG might be able to remain in the background because following the SSDL automatically generates the desired compliance evidence predictably and reliably. Increasingly, the DevOps approach of embedding compliance controls in automation shows up within software-defined infrastructure and networks rather than in human process and manual intervention. A firm doing this properly can explicitly associate satisfying its compliance concerns with following its SSDL.
