**[T1.5: 38] Deliver role-specific advanced curriculum.**


[Software security training](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/training.html) goes beyond building awareness by enabling students to incorporate security practices into their work. This training is tailored to cover the tools, technology stacks, development methodologies, and bugs that are most relevant to the students. For example, an organization could offer tracks for its engineers: one each for architects, developers, operations, site reliability engineers, and testers. Tool-specific training is also commonly needed in such a curriculum. While perhaps more concise than engineering training, role-specific training is necessary for many stakeholders within an organization, including product management, executives, and others.
