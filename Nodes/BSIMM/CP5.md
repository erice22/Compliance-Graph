**[CP1.2: 112] Identify PII obligations.**


The SSG plays a key role in identifying and describing PII obligations stemming from regulation and customer expectations by using this information to promote best practices related to privacy. The way software handles PII might be explicitly regulated, but even if it isn’t, privacy is an important topic. For example, if the organization processes credit card transactions, the SSG will help in identifying the constraints that the PCI DSS places on the handling of cardholder data and then inform all stakeholders. Note that outsourcing to hosted environments (e.g., the cloud) doesn’t relax PII obligations and can even increase the difficulty of recognizing all associated obligations. Also note that firms creating software products that process PII (where those firms don’t necessarily handle PII directly) might meet this need by providing privacy controls and guidance for their customers. Evolving consumer privacy expectations, the proliferation of “software is in everything,” and data scraping and correlation (e.g., social media) add additional expectations for PII protection.
