**[SR1.3: 94] Translate compliance constraints to requirements.**


Compliance constraints are translated into software requirements for individual projects and are communicated to the engineering teams. This is a linchpin in the organization’s compliance strategy: by representing compliance constraints explicitly with requirements and informing stakeholders, the organization demonstrates that compliance is a manageable task. For example, if the organization routinely builds software that processes credit card transactions, PCI DSS compliance plays a role in the SSDL during the requirements phase. In other cases, technology standards built for international interoperability can include security guidance on compliance needs. Representing these standards as requirements also helps with traceability and visibility in the event of an audit. It’s particularly useful to codify the requirements into reusable code or deployment artifact specifications.
