**[T1.8: 41] Include security resources in onboarding.**


The process for bringing new hires into an engineering organization requires that they complete a training module about software security. The generic new hire process usually covers topics like picking a good password and making sure that people don’t follow you into the building, but this orientation period can be enhanced to cover topics such as how to create, deploy, and operate secure code, the SSDL, and internal security resources (see [SR1.2 Create a security portal]). The objective is to ensure that new hires contribute to the security culture as soon as possible. Although a generic onboarding module is useful, it doesn’t take the place of a timely and more complete introductory software security course.
