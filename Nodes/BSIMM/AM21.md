**[AM2.7: 14] Build an internal forum to discuss attacks.**


The organization has an internal, interactive forum where the SSG, the satellite, incident response, and others discuss attacks and attack methods. The discussion serves to communicate the attacker perspective to everyone. The SSG can also maintain an internal mailing list that encourages subscribers to discuss the latest information on publicly known incidents. Dissection of attacks and exploits that are relevant to a firm are particularly helpful when they spur discussion of development, infrastructure, and other mitigations. Simply republishing items from public mailing lists doesnâ€™t achieve the same benefits as active discussion, nor does a closed discussion hidden from those actually creating code. Everyone should feel free to ask questions and learn about vulnerabilities and exploits (see [SR1.2 Create a security portal]).
