**[AM1.5: 57] Gather and use attack intelligence.**


The SSG ensures the organization stays ahead of the curve by learning about new types of attacks and vulnerabilities. Attending technical conferences and monitoring attacker forums, then correlating that information with what’s happening in the organization (perhaps by leveraging automation to mine operational logs and telemetry) helps the SSG learn more about emerging vulnerability exploitation. In many cases, a subscription to a commercial service can provide a reasonable way of gathering basic attack intelligence related to applications, APIs, containerization, orchestration, cloud environments, and so on. Regardless of its origin, attack information must be adapted to the organization’s needs and made actionable and useful for developers, testers, and DevOps and reliability engineers.
