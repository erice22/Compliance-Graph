**[AA2.2: 24] Standardize architectural descriptions.**


Defined AA processes use an agreed-upon format to describe architecture, including a means for representing data flow. Combining a documented process along with standardized architecture descriptions will make AA tractable for people who arenâ€™t security experts. High-level network diagrams, data flow, and authorization flows are always useful, but the description should go into detail about how the software itself is structured. A standard architecture description can be enhanced to provide an explicit picture of information assets that require protection, including useful metadata. Standardized icons that are consistently used in diagrams, templates, and whiteboard squiggles are especially useful, too.
