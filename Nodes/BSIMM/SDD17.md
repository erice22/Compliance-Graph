**[SFD3.1: 14] Form a review board or central committee to approve and maintain secure design patterns.**


A review board or central committee formalizes the process of reaching consensus on design needs and security tradeoffs. Unlike a typical architecture committee focused on functions, this group focuses on providing security guidance and also periodically reviews already published design standards (especially around authentication, authorization, and [cryptography](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-cryptography.html)) to ensure that design decisions don’t become stale or out of date. A review board can help control the chaos associated with adoption of new technologies when development groups might otherwise make decisions on their own without engaging the SSG. Review board security guidance also serves to inform outsourced software providers about security expectations (see [CP3.2 Impose policy on vendors]).
