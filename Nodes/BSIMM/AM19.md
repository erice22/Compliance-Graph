**[AM2.6: 10] Collect and publish attack stories.**


To maximize the benefit from lessons that don’t always come cheap, the SSG collects and publishes stories about attacks against the organization’s software. Both successful and unsuccessful attacks can be noteworthy, and discussing historical information about software attacks has the added effect of grounding software security in a firm’s reality. This is particularly useful in training classes to help counter a generic approach that might be overly focused on other organizations’ top 10 lists or outdated platform attacks (see [T2.8 Create and use material specific to company history]). Hiding or overly sanitizing information about attacks from people building new systems fails to garner any positive benefits from a negative happenstance.
