**[CP2.4: 48] Include software security SLAs in all vendor contracts.**


Software vendor contracts include an SLA to ensure the vendor won’t jeopardize the organization’s compliance story or SSI. Each new or renewed contract contains provisions requiring the vendor to address software security and deliver a product or service compatible with the organization’s security policy (see [SR2.5 Create SLA boilerplate]). In some cases, [open source licensing](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-licenses/) concerns initiate the vendor management process, which can open the door for additional software security language in the SLA. Typical provisions set requirements for policy conformance, incident management, training, and defect management. Traditional IT security requirements and a simple agreement to allow penetration testing aren’t sufficient here.
