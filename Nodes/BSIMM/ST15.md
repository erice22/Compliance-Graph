**[ST2.5: 16] Include security tests in QA automation.**


Security tests are included in an automation framework and run alongside other QA tests. While many groups trigger these tests manually, in a modern toolchain, these tests are likely part of the pipeline and triggered through automation. Security tests might be derived from abuse cases identified earlier in the lifecycle (see [AM2.1 Build attack patterns and abuse cases tied to potential attackers]), from creative tweaks of functional tests, developer tests, and security feature tests, or even from guidance provided by penetration testers on how to reproduce an issue.
