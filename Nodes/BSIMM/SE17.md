**[SE3.2: 13] Use code protection.**


To protect intellectual property and make exploit development harder, the organization erects barriers to reverse engineering its software (e.g., anti-tamper, debug protection, anti-piracy features, runtime integrity). This is particularly important for widely distributed code such as mobile applications and JavaScript distributed to browsers. For some software, obfuscation techniques could be applied as part of the production build and release process. In other cases, these protections could be applied at the software-defined network or software orchestration layer when applications are being dynamically regenerated post-deployment. On some platforms, employing Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Safe Structured Handling (SafeSEH), and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) can be a good start at making exploit development more difficult.
