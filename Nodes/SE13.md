**[SE2.4: 33] Protect code integrity.**


The organization can attest to the provenance, integrity, and authorization of important code before allowing it to execute. While legacy and mobile platforms accomplished this with point-in-time code signing and permissions activity, protecting modern containerized software demands actions in various lifecycle phases. Organizations can use build systems to verify sources and manifests of dependencies, creating their own cryptographic attestation of both. Packaging and deployment systems can sign and verify binary packages, including code, configuration, metadata, code identity, and authorization material. In some cases, organizations allow only code from their own registries to execute in certain environments. With many DevOps practices greatly increasing the number of people who can touch the code, organizations should also use permissions and peer review to govern code commits within source code management to help protect integrity.
