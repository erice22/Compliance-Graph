**[T3.1: 4] Reward progression through curriculum.**


Knowledge is its own reward, but progression through the security curriculum brings other benefits, too, such as career advancement. The reward system can be formal and lead to a certification or an official mark in the human resources system, or it can be less formal and include motivators such as documented praise at annual review time. Involving a corporate training department and/or human resources team can make securityâ€™s impact on career progression more obvious, but the SSG should continue to monitor security knowledge in the firm and not cede complete control or oversight. Coffee mugs and t-shirts can build morale, but it usually takes the possibility of real career progression to change behavior.
