**[SR2.2: 64] Create a standards review board.**


The organization creates a review board to formalize the process used to develop standards and to ensure that all stakeholders have a chance to weigh in. This standards review board could operate by appointing a champion for any proposed standard, putting the onus on the champion to demonstrate that the standard meets its goals and to get approval and buy-in from the review board. Enterprise architecture or enterprise risk groups sometimes take on the responsibility of creating and managing standards review boards. When the standards are implemented directly as software, the responsible champion might be a DevOps manager, release engineer, or whoever owns the associated deployment artifact (e.g., orchestration code).
