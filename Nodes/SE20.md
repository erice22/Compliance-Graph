 **[SE3.6: 12] Enhance application inventory with operations bill of materials.**


A list of applications and their locations in production environments is essential information for any well-run enterprise (see [CMVM2.3 Develop an operations inventory of software delivery value streams]). In addition, a manifest detailing the components, dependencies, configurations, external services, and so on for all production software helps the organization to tighten its security posture—that is, to react with agility as attackers and attacks evolve, compliance requirements change, and the number of items to patch grows quite large. Knowing where all the components live in running software—whether they’re in private data centers, in clouds, or sold as box products—allows for timely response when unfortunate events occur. Done properly, institutional use of container security solutions can make inventory efforts much simpler.
