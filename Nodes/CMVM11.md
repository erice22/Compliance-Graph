**[CMVM2.1: 94] Have emergency response.**


The organization can make quick code and configuration changes when software (e.g., application, API, microservice, infrastructure) is under attack, with a rapid-response team working in conjunction with application owners, developers, operators, and the SSG to study the code and the attack, find a resolution, and fix the production code (e.g., push a patch into production, rollback to a known-good version, deploy a new container). Often, the emergency response team is the engineering team itself. A well-defined process is a must here, but a process that has never been used might not actually work.
