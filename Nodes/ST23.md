**[ST3.4: 2] Leverage coverage analysis.**


Testers measure the code coverage of their security tests (see [ST2.5 Include security tests in QA automation]) to identify code that isn’t being exercised and then adjust automation (see [ST3.6 Implement event-driven security testing in automation]) to incrementally improve coverage. In turn, code coverage analysis drives increased security testing depth. Standard-issue black-box testing tools achieve exceptionally low coverage, leaving a majority of the software under test unexplored, which isn’t a testing best practice. Coverage analysis is easier when using standard measurements such as function coverage, line coverage, or multiple condition coverage.
