**[AM3.2: 4] Create and use automation to mimic attackers.**


The SSG arms engineers, testers, and incident response with automation to mimic what attackers are going to do. For example, a new attack method identified by an internal research group or a disclosing third party could require a new tool, so the SSG could package the tool and distribute it to testers. The idea here is to push attack capability past what typical commercial tools and offerings encompass, and then make that knowledge and technology easy for others to use. Tailoring these new tools to a firmâ€™s particular technology stacks and potential attackers increases the overall benefit. When technology stacks and coding languages evolve faster than vendors can innovate, creating tools and automation in-house might be the best way forward. In the DevOps world, these tools might be created by engineering and embedded directly into toolchains and automation (see [ST3.6 Implement event-driven security testing in automation]).
