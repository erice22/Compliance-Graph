**[AA3.2: 1] Drive analysis results into standard architecture patterns.**


Failures identified during AA are fed back to engineering teams so that similar mistakes can be prevented in the future through improved design patterns (see [SFD3.1 Form a review board or central committee to approve and maintain secure design patterns]). Cloud service providers have learned a lot about how their platforms and services fail to resist attack and have codified this experience into patterns for secure use. Organizations who heavily rely on these services might base their application-layer patterns on those building blocks provided by the cloud service provider (for example, AWS CloudFormation and Azure Blueprints) in making their own. Note that security design patterns can interact in surprising ways that break security, so the AA process should be applied even when vetted design patterns are in standard use.
