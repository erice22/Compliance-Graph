**[AA2.1: 23] Define and use AA process.**


The SSG defines and documents a process for AA and applies it in the design reviews it conducts to find flaws. This process includes a standardized approach for thinking about attacks, vulnerabilities, and various security properties. In addition to the technical impact discussions, the process includes a focus on the associated risk, such as through frequency or probability analysis, that gives stakeholders the information necessary to make decisions. The process is defined well enough that people outside the SSG can carry it out. It’s important to document both the architecture under review and any security flaws uncovered, as well as risk information people can understand and use. Microsoft’s STRIDE and Synopsys’s ARA are examples of such a process, although even these two methodologies for AA have evolved greatly over time. Individual ad hoc approaches to AA don’t count as a defined process.
