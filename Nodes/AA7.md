**[AA1.2: 41] Perform design review for high-risk applications.**


The organization learns the benefits of AA by seeing real results for a few high-risk, high-profile applications. Reviewers must have some experience performing detailed design reviews and breaking the architecture under consideration, especially for new platforms or environments. In all cases, a design review should produce a set of architecture flaws and a plan to mitigate them. If the SSG isn’t yet equipped to perform an in-depth AA, it can use consultants to do this work, but it should participate actively. Ad hoc review paradigms that rely heavily on expertise can be used here, but they don’t tend to scale in the long run. A review focused only on whether a software project has performed the right process steps won’t generate useful results about architecture flaws. Note that a sufficiently robust design review process can’t be executed at CI/CD speed.
