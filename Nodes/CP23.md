**[CP3.1: 26] Create a regulator compliance story.**


The SSG has information regulators want, so a combination of written policy, controls documentation, and artifacts gathered through the SSDL gives the SSG the ability to demonstrate the organization’s compliance story without a fire drill for every audit. Often, regulators, auditors, and senior management will be satisfied with the same kinds of reports that can be generated directly from various tools. In some cases, particularly where organizations leverage shared responsibility cloud services, the organization will require additional information from vendors about how that vendor’s controls support organizational compliance needs. It will often be necessary to normalize information that comes from disparate sources. While they are often the biggest, governments aren’t the only regulators of behavior.
