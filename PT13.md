**[PT2.2: 30] Penetration testers use all available information.**


Penetration testers, whether internal or external, use source code, design documents, architecture analysis results, misuse and abuse cases, code review results, and cloud environment and other deployment configuration to do deeper analysis and find more interesting problems. To effectively do their job, penetration testers often need everything created throughout the SSDL, so an SSDL that creates no useful artifacts about the code will make this effort harder. Having access to the artifacts is not the same as using them.
