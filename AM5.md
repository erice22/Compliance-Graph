**[AM1.2: 81] Create a data classification scheme and inventory.**


Security stakeholders in an organization agree on a data classification scheme and use it to inventory software, delivery artifacts (e.g., containers), and associated persistent stores according to the kinds of data processed or services called, regardless of deployment model (e.g., on- or off-premise). This allows applications to be prioritized by their data classification. Many classification schemes are possible—one approach is to focus on PII, for example. Depending on the scheme and the software involved, it could be easiest to first classify data repositories (see [CP2.1 Build PII inventory]) and then derive classifications for applications according to the repositories they use. Other approaches to the problem include data classification according to protection of intellectual property, impact of disclosure, exposure to attack, relevance to GDPR, and geographic boundaries.
