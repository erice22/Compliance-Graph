**[ST2.6: 13] Perform fuzz testing customized to application APIs.**


QA efforts include running a customized fuzzing framework against APIs critical to the organization. They could begin from scratch or use an existing fuzzing toolkit, but the necessary customization often goes beyond creating custom protocol descriptions or file format templates to giving the fuzzing framework a built-in understanding of the application interfaces it calls into. Test harnesses developed explicitly for particular applications make good places to integrate fuzz testing.
