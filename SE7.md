**[SE1.2: 121] Ensure host and network security basics are in place.**


The organization provides a solid foundation for its software by ensuring that host and network security basics are in place across its data centers and networks and ensuring it remains in place during new releases. Evolving network perimeters, increased connectivity and data sharing, and increasing interdependence on vendors (e.g., content delivery, load balancing, and content inspection services) add a degree of difficulty even to getting the basics right. Doing software security before getting host and network security in place is like putting on shoes before putting on socks.
