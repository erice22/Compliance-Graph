**[T2.5: 32] Enhance satellite through training and events.**


The SSG strengthens the satellite network by inviting guest speakers or holding special events about advanced topics (e.g., the latest software security techniques for DevOps or cloud-native technologies). This effort is about providing to the satellite customized training so that it can fulfill its specific responsibilities, not about inviting the satellite members to routine brown bags or signing them up for the standard computer-based training. In addition, a standing conference call with voluntary attendance wonâ€™t get the desired results, which are as much about building camaraderie as they are about sharing knowledge and organizational efficiency. Face-to-face meetings are by far the most effective, even if they happen only once or twice a year and some participants must attend over videoconferencing. In teams with many geographically dispersed and work-from-home members, simply turning on cameras and ensuring everyone gets a chance to speak makes a substantial difference.
