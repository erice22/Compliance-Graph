**[T3.5: 7] Establish SSG office hours.**


The SSG or equivalent stakeholder offers help to anyone during an advertised meet-up period or regularly scheduled office hours. By acting as an informal resource for people who want to solve security problems, the SSG leverages teachable moments and emphasizes the carrot over the stick approach to security best practices. Office hours might be hosted one afternoon per week by a senior SSG member, but flexible office hours are also a possibility, with visits to particular product or application groups by request, perhaps prioritizing visits by key functionality being developed and its security implications. Slack and other messaging applications can capture questions 24x7 as a good way to seed office hours conversations, but instant messages alone arenâ€™t a replacement for conversation and problem-solving.
