**[SM2.1: 64] Publish data about software security internally.**


To facilitate improvement, data are published internally about the state of software security within the organization. This information might come in the form of a dashboard with metrics for executives and software development management. Sometimes, these published data won’t be shared with everyone in the firm but only with relevant executives who then drive change in the organization. In other cases, open book management and data published to all stakeholders help everyone know what’s going on, the philosophy being that sunlight is the best disinfectant. If the organization’s culture promotes internal competition between groups, this information can add a security dimension. Increasingly, security telemetry is used to gather measurements quickly and accurately, and might initially focus less on historical trends (e.g., bugs per release) and more on speed (e.g., time to fix) and quality (e.g., defect density). Some SSIs might publish these data primarily in engineering groups within pipeline platform dashboards, democratizing measurement for developer self-improvement.
