**[CP1.1: 94] Unify regulatory pressures.**


If the business or its customers are subject to regulatory or compliance drivers such as PCI security standards; GLBA, SOX, and HIPAA in the US; or [GDPR](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-gdpr.html) in the EU, the SSG acts as a focal point for understanding the constraints such drivers impose on software. In some cases, the SSG creates or collaborates on a unified approach that removes redundancy and conflicts from overlapping compliance requirements. A formal approach will map applicable portions of regulations to controls applied to software to explain how the organization complies. As an alternative, existing business processes run by legal or other risk and compliance groups outside the SSG could also serve as the regulatory focal point. A unified set of software security guidance for meeting regulatory pressures ensures that compliance work is completed as efficiently as possible. Some firms move on to influencing the regulatory environment directly by becoming involved in standards groups exploring new technologies and mandates.
