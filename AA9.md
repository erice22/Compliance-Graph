**[AA1.3: 32] Have SSG lead design review efforts.**


The SSG takes a lead role in AA by performing a design review to uncover flaws. Breaking down an architecture is enough of an art that the SSG must be proficient at it before it can turn the job over to architects, and proficiency requires practice. The SSG can’t be successful on its own, either; it will likely need help from architects or implementers to understand the design. With a clear design in hand, the SSG might be able to carry out the detailed review with a minimum of interaction with the project team. Over time, the responsibility for leading review efforts should shift toward software security architects. Approaches to AA evolve over time, so it’s wise to not expect to set a process and use it forever.
