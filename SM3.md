**[SM1.1: 94] Publish process and evolve as necessary.**


The process for addressing software security is published and broadcast to all stakeholders so that everyone knows the plan. Goals, roles, responsibilities, and activities are explicitly defined. Most organizations pick an existing methodology, such as the Microsoft SDL or the Synopsys Touchpoints, and then tailor it to meet their needs. Security activities, such as those grouped into an SSDL process, are adapted to software lifecycle processes (e.g., waterfall, agile, [CI/CD](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-cicd.html), [DevOps](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-devops.html)) so activities will evolve with both the organization and the security landscape. In many cases, the process is defined by the SSG and published only internally; it doesnâ€™t need to be publicly promoted outside the firm to have the desired impact. In addition to publishing the written process, some firms also encode it into an application lifecycle management (ALM) tool as software-defined workflow.
