**[SR1.2: 90] Create a security portal.**


The organization has a well-known central location for information about software security. Typically, this is an internal website maintained by the SSG that people refer to for the latest and greatest on security standards and requirements, as well as for other resources provided by the SSG (e.g., training). An interactive wiki is better than a static portal with guideline documents that rarely change. Organizations can supplement these materials with mailing lists, chat channels, and face-to-face meetings. Development teams are increasingly putting software security knowledge directly into toolchains and automation that is outside the organization (e.g., GitHub), but that does not remove the need for SSG-led knowledge management.
