**[CP3.3: 8] Drive feedback from software lifecycle data back to policy.**


Information from the [software lifecycle](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-sdlc.html) is routinely fed back into the policy creation and maintenance process to prevent defects from occurring in the first place and to help strengthen governance-as-code practices. With this process, blind spots can be eliminated by mapping them to trends in SSDL failures. The regular appearance of inadequate architecture analysis, recurring vulnerabilities, ignored security release conditions, or the wrong firm choice for carrying out a [penetration test](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing.html) can expose policy weakness. As an example, lifecycle data might indicate that policies impose too much bureaucracy by introducing friction that prevents engineering from meeting the expected delivery cadence. Rapid technology evolution might also create policy gaps that must be addressed. Over time, policies become more practical and easier to carry out (see [SM1.1 Publish process and evolve as necessary]). Ultimately, policies are refined with SSDL data to enhance and improve a firmâ€™s effectiveness.
