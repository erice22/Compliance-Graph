**[SR3.3: 9] Use secure coding standards.**


Secure coding standards help the organization’s developers avoid the most obvious bugs and provide ground rules for code review. These standards are necessarily specific to a programming language or platform, and they can address the use of popular frameworks, APIs, libraries, and infrastructure automation. Platforms might include mobile or IoT runtimes, cloud service provider APIs, orchestration runtimes, and SaaS platforms (e.g., Salesforce, SAP). If the organization already has coding standards for other purposes, its secure coding standards should build upon them. A clear set of secure coding standards is a good way to guide both manual and automated code review, as well as to provide relevant examples for security training. Some groups might choose to integrate their secure coding standards directly into automation. While enforcement isn’t the point at this stage (see [CR3.5 Enforce secure coding standards]), violation of the standards is a good teachable moment for all stakeholders. Socializing the benefits of following the standards is also a good first step to gaining widespread acceptance.
