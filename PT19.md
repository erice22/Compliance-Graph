**[PT3.1: 21] Use external penetration testers to perform deep-dive analysis.**


The organization uses external penetration testers to do deep-dive analysis for critical projects and to introduce fresh thinking into the SSG. These testers should be domain experts and specialists who keep the organization up to speed with the latest version of the attackerâ€™s perspective and have a track record for breaking the type of software being tested. Skilled penetration testers will always break a system, but the question is whether they demonstrate new kinds of thinking about attacks that can be useful when designing, implementing, and hardening new systems. Creating new types of attacks from threat intelligence and abuse cases typically requires extended timelines, which is essential when it comes to new technologies, and prevents checklist-driven approaches that look only for known types of problems.
