**[SR3.4: 25] Create standards for technology stacks.**


The organization standardizes on specific technology stacks. This means a reduced workload because teams donâ€™t have to explore new technology risks for every new project. The organization might create a secure base configuration (commonly in the form of golden images, AMIs, etc.) for each technology stack, further reducing the amount of work required to use the stack safely. In cloud environments, hardened configurations likely include up-to-date security patches, security configuration, and security services, such as logging and monitoring. In traditional on-premise IT deployments, a stack might include an operating system, a database, an application server, and a runtime environment (e.g., a LAMP stack). Where the technology will be reused, such as containers, microservices, or orchestration code, the security frontier is a good place to find traction; standards for secure use of these reusable technologies means that getting security right in one place positively impacts the security posture of all downstream dependencies (see [SE2.5 Use application containers]).
