**[SE2.6: 36] Ensure cloud security basics.**


Organizations should already be ensuring that their host and network security basics are in place, but they must also ensure that basic requirements are met in cloud environments. Of course, cloud-based virtual assets often have public-facing services that create an attack surface (e.g., cloud-based storage) that is different from the one in a private data center, so these assets require customized security configuration and administration. In the increasingly software-defined world, the SSG has to help everyone explicitly implement cloud-based security features and controls (some of which can be built in, for example, cloud provider administration consoles) that are comparable to those built with cables and physical hardware in private data centers. Detailed knowledge about cloud provider shared responsibility security models is always necessary.Â
